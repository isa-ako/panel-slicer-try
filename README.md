# panel-slicer-try
it's a simple concept about slicing panels of a comic strip with 4-koma layout.
this code's purpose is to convert 4-koma layout into webtoon format.

method :
breaking panels from upper left to the bottom,
then move to the right side of the top panel earlier,
then go to the bottom and so on till it's reach lower right panel.

note :
it's only work for panel with vertical and horizontal border only.
won't work on diagonal border.

I'll re-write this code with Rust language, and create a new repo.
so this repo won't have an update.
